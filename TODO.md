# TODO sequence

* DONE merge 850C style rx comms code with the existing SW102 code
* DONE merge the 850C style tx comms code with the existing SW102 code
* DONE merge the 850C eeprom code, keeping as much as possible in common
* DONE call the rx/tx comms loop every 20ms from the main loop (needed to fix app timers first)
* DONE make the rtc stubs do something
* DONE turn on eeprom writing
* DONE semi-cruftily port over the 850C button code 
* DONE make accel button presses work
* DONE make all other button presses (excluding config) work
* DONE add a logical buttons abstraction and callbacks for screen button handling
* DONE turn on system power / turn off system power per button press
* show current selection in selection menus
* make config entry presses work
* handle hierarchical menu entry/exit correctly
* Make short press of power - cycle to next screen?
* change fault screen to be serviced via the regular main loop (but only for first fault, to prevent bricking the user's ability to powerdown)
* make a shutdown screen
* make a boot screen (show until user releases power button)
* DONE test to make sure only one EEPROM record is getting written
* test with real motor (after triple checking wiring color questions)
* make config system (hopefully usable on other platforms)
* delete dead code in mainscreen.c
* initial release
* FIXME - wait for last flash write to complete before powering down
* FIXME - pingpong between two rx buffers, current implementation allows ISR to overwrite the buffer being used by
the GUI thread.  Use two buffers + a ptr.
* use battery icon
* pack & align eeprom
* FIXME - make width 0, and height 0 mean "auto select based on display size"
* do eeprom GC if flash is full (currently only done at boot)
* merge with 850C code somewhat? (sharing behavior - just different UX layer and HAL)
* clean up button handling and take advantage of extra button on the SW102
