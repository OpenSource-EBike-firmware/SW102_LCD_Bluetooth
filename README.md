# WARNING: Deprecated - moved into Color_LCD

** This project has been merged into [Color_LCD](https://github.com/OpenSource-EBike-firmware/Color_LCD).  ALL future development
will be done there.  Do not fork this repo, fork that one instead. **

We've made a lot of good improvements and now share almost all of the code between the SW102 and 850C controllers.

This repo will stay around so old releases keep working, but new binary releases will also be made in that repo.  Do not record new 
bugs here, record them there.
